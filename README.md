# F Health Sphere

F Health Sphere is an intelligent personal healthcare platform integrating IoT and AI technology to automate health management, enable real-time health tracking, and provide early warnings for potential health risks.

## 1. Problem Statement

Many people struggle to monitor their blood pressure effectively. Without proper medical devices, accurate measurement becomes difficult. This platform aims to provide an automated solution, allowing users to track their health status quickly and accurately.

## 2. Solution

F Health Sphere builds a platform that integrates AI and IoT to:

- **Real-time Health Monitoring**: Integrate IoT devices (e.g., smart wearables, blood pressure monitors, heart rate trackers) to send real-time data to a central server for analysis.
  
- **AI-driven Analysis**: Utilize AI to analyze medical data, detect warning signs (such as abnormal heart rate or blood pressure levels), and notify users or doctors of potential health risks.

- **Personal Health Record Management**: Store and manage health history, allowing easy access to medical information via mobile applications.

- **Reminders & Personalization**: Provide automated reminders for health checkups, medication intake, and suggest healthy habits based on individual health status.

- **Mobile App Integration**: Users can monitor their health data, receive AI-driven alerts and recommendations, and quickly contact doctors or family members in emergencies.

## 3. Key Features

- Real-time blood pressure and heart rate monitoring.
- AI-powered medical data analysis for early risk detection.
- Alerts and notifications for users and doctors regarding health risks.
- Personal health record storage and management.
- Automated reminders for medical appointments and medication intake.
- Mobile application for on-the-go health tracking and emergency contact.

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (or Next.js for web, React Native or Flutter for mobile app).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js or Python with Django/FastAPI.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- **IoT Communication**: MQTT.
- **AI**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for medical data analysis.
